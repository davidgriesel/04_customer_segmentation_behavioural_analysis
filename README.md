# Customer Segmentation & Behavioural Analysis
*This project was completed as part of the [CareerFoundry Data Analytics Programme](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-data-analyst/).*

## Overview
An online grocery store that engages with customers through a mobile app is looking to refine its marketing strategy using data-driven insights. This project uses Python to analyse demographic and transactional data, creating customer segments and spending profiles that inform targeted product placement and personalised marketing strategies.

## Tools
- **Python** (Jupyter | Anaconda) - Scripting
- **pandas | numpy | os** - Data Processing & Manipulation
- **matplotlib | seaborn** - Plotting | Visualisation
<!--- **Excel** - Reporting-->

## Process
- **Data Preparation** - Wrangling | Merging | Subsetting | Grouping | Aggregation | Deriving new Variables
- **Analysis** - Exploratory Analysis | Segmentation & Profiling | Descriptive Statistics | Trend Analysis
- **Communication** - Visualisation | Reporting

## Data
This analysis uses publicly available data originally sourced from **Instacart** via **Kaggle**. The links as well as an additional customers dataset was provided by **CareerFoundry** as part of their Data Analytics Course.

- [**Customers**](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/data-immersion/A4/A4_Data_Assets/customers.zip) - Customer ID, Name, Surname, Gender, State, Age, Date Joined, Dependants, Family Status, and Income
- [**Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis)

    - **Departments** - Department id and name
    - **OrdersProducts** - Order id, product id, add to cart order, and reorder indicator.
    - **Orders** - Order is, order number, order day of week, order hour of day, days since prior order.
    - **Products** - Product id, name, aisle, department, and price.

The Instacart Dataset was accessed on 7 September 2024.

## Key Insights
### 1. Customer order activity follows a predictable rhythm shaped by consistent daily and weekly cycles.

A clear daily cycle emerges with low overnight activity, a morning surge, sustained midday volume, and a steady evening decline. This rhythm is consistent across the week, indicating routine-based purchasing behaviour.

Layered over the daily rhythm is a weekly cycle that amplifies this pattern over weekends. Saturday consistently records the highest order volumes, while Sunday starts strong only to level off earlier, forming a hybrid pattern of high morning demand and a less active afternoon.

This predictable behaviour provides opportunities to optimise staffing, inventory, and promotional efforts by aligning with the dual rhythm of daily and weekly order cycles.

            <em> <strong>Weekend Surge:</strong> A significant increase in order volume occurs over the weekend, which peaks on Saturday.</em>

            <em><strong>Amplified Weekend Volume:</strong> Midday peaks are significantly more pronounced over the weekend, with Saturday reaching the highest volumes of the week. Sunday exhibits a similar but less consistent pattern that drops off sooner.</em>

            <em><strong>Unique Sunday Pattern:</strong> Unlike the other days which show a relatively flat midday peak, Sunday's activity is less consistent. It features high volumes around 9 am, followed by a slight but noticeable drop to a lower, yet still elevated, plateau until approximately 4 pm.</em>

### 3. How can products be categorised into price ranges to support product placement?


### 4. Which products, within their respective departments and categories, are most popular?


### 5. How can ordering behaviour and demographic information be used to categorise customers?


### 6. How does ordering habits vary across customer profiles?


## Takeaways
### Successes
The project provided actionable insights into ordering behaviour across customer profiles, enabling a more targeted marketing strategy through better product placement.

### Challenges
While data wrangling was straightforward, producing clear visualisations in Python required significant customisation. Unlike Tableauâ€™s interactive interface, Python tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn needed more effort to ensure readability and interpretability.

### Way Forward
Building a Tableau storyboard to present key findings in an interactive format could enhance storytelling and enable stakeholders to explore trends, segments, and behaviours through dynamic dashboards and filters.
